# The-Citadel-Jury
A small side project built using langchain which reviews the user's scientific claims/abstracts under a jurisdiction playground environment.

## Use-cases
- User got an idea on some research topic on how he/she can introduce a new thing, so using this the user can verify his/her scientific claim which might not be possible at such depth by human.
- fact checking purposes.
- Having fun with LLMs ;)


## How to use
- Download the repo code
- The implementation of this project is based upon Groq hence the user needs to provice the Groq API key so that it can communicate with LLMs
- User can update the LLM type in the main.py file based upon the models provided by Groq and based upon user's preference.
- Make sure langchain is installed along with groq component.
- Execute the command: python3 main.py.
- Enjoy the whole new world of LLM conversations. :)
